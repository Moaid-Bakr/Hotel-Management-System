# Hotel-Management-System


The purpose of creating the project or problem?
To integrate reservation, billing, and services. 


Weaknesses of the hotel:
Hotel has different departments such as billing, room service, other services, and reservations, and
these departments do not have an integrated system to see customer information/ transactions in one page.

With the help of this data model, we are trying to solve the above-mentioned problem by creating an integrated system to manage all services in the hotel.
This will also help to understand customer behavior.

To ease booking by having real-time room availability information at the booking counter/ or another third-party
booking and provide a centralized billing system in the hotel. Also, customer data can be analyzed. Unfortunately,
I cannot do this here due to the lack of a data set.

I will use the ER model techniques to solve this problem.
